    "## 4.1 Topological Ordering of Animal Species\n",

    "The SOM algorithm can be used to assign a natural order to objects characterized only by a large number of attributes. This is done by letting the SOM\n",
    "algorithm create a topological mapping from the high-dimensional attribute\n",
    "space to a one-dimensional output space.\n",
    "\n",
    "As sample data, please use a simple database of 32 animal species where\n",
    "each animal is characterized by 84 binary attributes. The data is in the \u001c",
    "le\n",
    "animals.dat. This file defines the 32×84 matrix props where each row contains\n",
    "the attributes of one animal. The data are organised in row-by-row manner. There is also a file animalnames.dat with the names of the animals in the same\n",
    "order. This vector should only be used to print out the final ordering in a more\n",
    "readable format. These 84 values serve as input and 100 nodes arranged in a\n",
    "one-dimensional topology, i.e. in a linear sequence, constitute the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train the SOM network by showing the attribute vector of one animal at a\n",
    "time. The SOM algorithm should now be able to create a mapping onto the 100\n",
    "output nodes such that similar animals tend to be close while different animals\n",
    "tend to be further away along the sequence of nodes. In order to get this one-dimensional topology, the network has to be trained using a one-dimensional\n",
    "neighbourhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, your task is to write the core algorithm. Use a weight matrix\n",
    "of size 100 × 84 initialized with random numbers between zero and one. Use an outer loop to train the network for about 20 epochs, and an inner loop which\n",
    "loops through the 32 animals, one at a time. For each animal you will have to\n",
    "pick out the corresponding row from the props matrix. Then find the row of the\n",
    "weight matrix with the shortest distance to this attribute vector (p). Note that\n",
    "you cannot use a scalar product since the attribute vectors are not normalized.\n",
    "Therefore you have to take the difference between the two vectors and calculate\n",
    "the length of this difference vector. Once you have the index to the winning\n",
    "node, it is time to update the weights. Update the weights so that they come a\n",
    "bit closer to the input pattern. A suitable step size is 0.2. Note that only weights\n",
    "to the winning node and its neighbours should be updated. The neighbours are\n",
    "in this case the nodes with an index close to that of the winning one. You\n",
    "should start with a large neighbourhood and gradually make it smaller. Make\n",
    "the size of the neighbourhood depend on the epoch loop variable so that you\n",
    "start with a neighbourhood of about 50 and end up close to one or zero.Finally,\n",
    "you have to print out the result, i.e. the animals in a natural order. Do this\n",
    "by looping through all animals once more, again calculating the index of the\n",
    "winning output node. Save these indices in a 32 element vector pos. By sorting\n",
    "this vector we will get the animals in the desired order. Check the resulting\n",
    "order. Does it make sense? If everything works, animals next to each other\n",
    "in the listing should always have some similarity between them. Insects should\n",

    "- The size of the neighbourhood must be smaller, corresponding to the smaller number of output nodes. It is reasonable to start with a neighbourhood size of 2 and then change it to 1 and finally zero.\n",
