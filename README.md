# Artifical Neural Networks and Deep Architercures labs

This repository contains the lab assignments for the course DD2437-Artificial neural networks and deep architectures at KTH. Each folder contains the assignment in pdf format, a notebook with the experiments performed for the lab, and the code for a variety of Neural Networks.

In particular, each lab comprises the following implementations:

| **Folder** |                       **Neural Networks**                       |
|:----------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    lab1    |             Perceptron, Multi Layer Perceptron(MLP)             |
|    lab2    | Radial Basis Function(RBF) Networks, Self Organizing Maps(SOMs) |
|    lab3    |                        Hopfield Networks                        |
|    lab4    |  Restricted Boltzman Machines(RBMs), Deep Belief Networks(DBNs) |
